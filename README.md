# TPU Pipeline

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for setting up and running a TPU-based machine learning pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:

- A Google Cloud account with billing enabled.
- A GCP project with TPU resources available.
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured.
- Python 3.x installed.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform google-cloud-storage google-cloud-pipeline-components
```

## Configuration

Set up your GCP project ID and region:

```python
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
REGION = "us-central1"
! gcloud config set project {PROJECT_ID} --quiet
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook tpu_pipeline.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the notebook cells to set up and deploy the TPU pipeline.
3. Monitor the execution and review logs in Google Cloud Console.

## Output

- The pipeline will train a machine learning model using TPU resources.
- Results will be stored in the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors, ensure:

- Your GCP credentials are correctly set up (`gcloud auth login`).
- TPU resources are properly allocated in your GCP project.
- Required Python libraries are installed.
